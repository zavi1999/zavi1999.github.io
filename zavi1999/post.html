                        <p>Nonbinary is an experimental electronic song and is the first single on Arca’s 2020 album     KiCk i. Arca is a Venezuelan born artist and music producer who gained popularity from her collaborations with high-profile artist such as Björk and Frank Ocean.  Ever since coming out as transgender, Arca’s music has become an outlet for navigating the feelings and challenges that come with transitioning. Nonbinary is the embodiment of Arca’s inner struggle with herself and her gender identity. The song explores and denounces binary thinking and its effects on our perception of ourselves and the world. “I wanted to introduce the concept of self-states. When I talk about a self-state as a system of personalities that each of us can have, that’s a very loaded term. It’s an idea of integration and inclusion; it’s not supposed to be scary,” said Arca in her album introduction on Apple Music. “Go ahead, speak for yourself, cast the first stone, if you wanna be a puppet, better yet speak for your self-states,” Arca sings. This line serves as a rejection to social norms that inhibit our self-expression. So often we find ourselves taking on the ideals and perspectives that are fed to us by the mainstream without much question until we inevitably take on those ideals as our own. </p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
                        <p>Arca invites us to question our own perspectives, to determine what is true to us, separate from our cultural values and the social norms put upon us. In the ending of the music video for Nonbinary, Arca argues with two versions of herself, one dressed in a frilly white blouse and the other in a black corset and shoulder pads, surrounded by flames as she sings, “I can be sexy or I could be sad, act bad just to be sweet, what a treat it is to be nonbinary, ma chérie,” This serves as a visualization of the constant struggle of bringing together and coming to terms with two opposing versions of ourselves, and the lyrics suggest that in coming to terms with her gender identity Arca has transcended the need for consolidation and views herself outside of the binary, realizing that she and everyone is multi-faceted and complex. Arca and her music serve as an insight to the perspectives of trans people in a media culture that largely ignores or insults the notion of living outside gender binaries or being anything other than cisgender. Just as influential to her music, is Arca’s upbringing as a queer youth in the country of Venezuela. 

</p>
                        <p>In an interview with paper magazine, Arca recalls her upbringing in Venezuela being surrounded by the sounds of cacerolazos, a form of protests where citizens gather and bang on pots and pan, “it happened so often that I'm sure it left some unconscious mark on me of what it means to protest through sonics.” Sonically, Arca’s Nonbinary encapsulates this mood through her signature glitched out percussion beats that clash together as the song comes to a close.</p>
